# portfolio-mk-ii

Updated portfolio using BootStrap and jQuerey cdn's

User uses Nav bar to navigate multiple html docs

Contact DOC uses a form to send quick messages *still needs functionality* and icons link to GitHub Profile,
LinkedIn profile *need to make a LinkedIn account*, and launches user's email linked to my own.

Projects feature images from apps on cards and have buttons to navigate to the apps themselves and to corresponding repositories.

About section will hold background/resume information and show languages and libraries that I have had experience/exposure with/to.
